subtitle: "*Toy Microsimulation of Labour Mismatch*"
description: "This module implements a simple microsimulation of labour mismatch based on a static version of the two-sided matching model developed by Zinn (2012). The purpose of the simulation is to produce matching outcomes of a labour market populated by a set of workers and a set of jobs with pre-defined characteristics and compute the output of various mismatch measures. This can then be analysed to gain a deeper understanding of the construct of the mismatch measures."
